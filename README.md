# Comprehensive Healthcare for America: Using the Insights of Behavioral Economics to Transform the U.S. Healthcare System

This project uses OpenAI's GPT-3 language model to generate a research paper titled "Comprehensive Healthcare for America: Using the Insights of Behavioral Economics to Transform the U.S. Healthcare System." The paper covers various aspects of healthcare reform, including lessons from behavioral economics, proposals for system reform, and implementation strategies.

## Overview

The generated research paper includes the following sections:
1. Title
2. Abstract
3. Introduction
4. Lessons of Behavioral Economics: Achieving Acceptance of CHA
5. Proposals to Reform the Healthcare System
6. The Tenets of “Comprehensive Healthcare for America”
